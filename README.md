# Todo Guide

The todo list that guides you through your day!

Todo Guide helps manage expectations so you can focus on what's really important. Here's how it works:

* Add and prioritize your todo items
* Todo Guide shows those items in a calendar view so youknow realistically when they'll be done

When tasks take longer or shorter than expected, Todo Guide will shift your entire schedule accordingly!

## Developer Quick Start

After you've cloned the repo:

The page will reload if you make edits and you will see any lint errors in the console.

```

Correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance in the `build/` folder. See the React docs for [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
